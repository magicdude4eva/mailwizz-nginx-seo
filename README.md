MailWizz nginx example with search-engine friendly URLs - this has been tested with MailWizz 1.3.6.x running on CentOS 7 with nginx/1.6.3

The nginx configuration includes:
- SSL and non SSL config
- PHP FPM
- Support for tracking domains
- SSL configuration with SSL stapling and tuning
- Gzip compression
- Security configuration
 - Turn off access to hidden files and sensitive context
 - XSS configuration to enforce SAMEORIGIN
 - Limiting buffer overflow issues
 - Restricting request methods
 - CSP in reporting mode (ensure that you register with report-uri.io / or remove)
- Remove logging of favicon.ico and robots.txt
- Custom error pages for nginx (those could be much better)
- Cache control for media images, dynamic data and CSS/JavaScript

Included MySQL configuration and php.ini settings for a MailWizz system running on CentOS7, MySQL 5.7.12, nginx on a 4-core, 10GB single-server.

## Sessions via PHP-FPM
PHP-FPM by default writes sessions into the /var/lib/php directory and I personally do not like assigning nginx permissions to it (since MailWizz stores session info). I have therefore adjusted PHP-FPM config to have it's own directory.

You will need to run this (or adjust /etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf):
```
mkdir -p /var/lib/nginx/session
mkdir -p /var/lib/nginx/wsdlcache
chown -R nginx:nginx /var/lib/nginx
```

## About SSL-stapling
I use Thawte SSL123 certs and you will notice in the SSL configuration a reference to `ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/pki/tls/certs/combined-certs.crt;`. I suggest you read up about SSL stapling first: https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/OCSP_Stapling_on_nginx.html.

The `ssl_trusted_certificate` needs to be in a specific order, and this worked for me (copy each cert in this sequence into the file):
- The Webserver certificate - this is the cert for the domain and will be included in the SSL cert order email
- The intermediate CA - this will also be included in the SSL cert order email
- The primary root CA - for SSL123 Thawte it can be obtained from here: https://www.thawte.com/roots/thawte_Primary_Root_CA.pem

You can then test the SSL stapling via:
```
openssl s_client -connect yourdomain.com:443 -tls1 -tlsextdebug -status
```
Which will output something like this:
```
